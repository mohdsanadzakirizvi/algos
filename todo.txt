List of todo actions to be performed on respective algorithms:

1. document_distance.py :
  [ ] - Determine and improve the time complexity. 
  [X] - right now the split() function is splitting words based on white spaces ,improve it so that it splits 
        the words on basis of other delimeters. 
  [ ] - Replace two if's by a single if-else when looking for word in Dictionary that way one less comparison will be made.
  [ ] - Instead of reading lines into a list of lines and then creating a dictionary , directly read line by line and create a dictionary . This will save memory and time and prevent one whole function and function call.
WHERE [ ] = Not Done
[X] = Done
